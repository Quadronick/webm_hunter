# WebM Hunter
WebM Hunter is a simple python3 app, that creates an M3U playlist filled with dubious video content.
Just another demonstration of possible usage of 'json', 'requests' and 'argparse' modules at once.

# How to use this?
./webm_hunter.py --board `<BOARD_CODE>`, where `<BOARD_CODE>` is a String. Full list of boards could be found at https://2ch.hk.
